* :tada: **Never forget a birthday!** You can sync birthdays and other recurring events with your Nextcloud Calendar.
* :busts_in_silhouette: **Sharing of Adressbooks!** You want to share your contacts with your friends or coworkers? No problem!
* :see_no_evil: **We’re not reinventing the wheel!** Based on the great and open SabreDAV library.

## :hammer_and_wrench: Installation

In your Nextcloud, simply navigate to "Apps", choose the category "Organization", find the Contacts app and enable it.
